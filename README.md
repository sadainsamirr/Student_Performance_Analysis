# Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing student performance based on various factors such as gender, parent's education, parent's marital status, and ethnic group. The analysis is conducted using Python and popular data manipulation and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a CSV file named `student_score.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- `Gender`: Gender of the student
- `ParentEduc`: Education level of the parent
- `ParentMaritalStatus`: Marital status of the parent
- `EthnicGroup`: Ethnic group of the student
- `WklyStudyHours`: Weekly study hours of the student
- `MathScore`, `ReadingScore`, `WritingScore`: Scores of the student in Math, Reading, and Writing respectively.

## Code Overview

- `student_performance_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `student_score.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Checking for missing values, handling data inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Exploring the gender distribution among students.
   - Analyzing the relationship between parent's education level and student scores.
   - Investigating the impact of parent's marital status on student scores.
   - Visualizing the distribution of ethnic groups among students.
3. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## How to Use

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `student_performance_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and visualize the results.
